Data Inspection: Applied commands such as awk, du, wc, and grep for a thorough examination of fang_et_al_genotypes.txt and snp_position.txt. This allowed for the assessment of column quantities, overall file size, and content inspection.

Genotypic Data extraction for Maize and Teosinte: Conducted this based on group classifications. Performed data transposition, sorting, and merging with SNP positional information. This led to the creation of multiple, distinct files for each species, tailored to SNP locations and chromosomal positions, inclusive of special considerations for multiple and unknown locations.

This README document contains the workflow's framework, outlining the analytical procedures undertaken and the resultant data files.
