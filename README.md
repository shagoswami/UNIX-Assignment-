Data Inspection: Applied commands such as awk, du, wc, and grep for a thorough examination of fang_et_al_genotypes.txt and snp_position.txt. This allowed for the assessment of column quantities, overall file size, and content inspection.

Genotypic Data extraction for Maize and Teosinte: Conducted this based on group classifications. Performed data transposition, sorting, and merging with SNP positional information. This led to the creation of multiple, distinct files for each species, tailored to SNP locations and chromosomal positions, inclusive of special considerations for multiple and unknown locations.

Chromosomal Data Compilation: Constructed specialized files for maize and teosinte, each corresponding to individual chromosomes. These files cataloged SNPs in sequences arranged by both ascending and descending positional values, incorporating unique symbols to denote absent data.

Specialized Output Files: Compiled unique datasets enumerating SNPs lacking known positions or exhibiting multiple locational attributes. Additionally, generated detailed, chromosomal files listing SNPs in positional order. This ensured the preservation of data integrity and its readiness for subsequent analytical procedures.

This README document encapsulates the workflow's framework, outlining the analytical procedures undertaken and the resultant data files. It is concise, encapsulating the critical methodologies and results, while abstaining from an exhaustive exposition of the specific commands utilized in the workflow.
